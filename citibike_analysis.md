# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
In our data analysis of the Citi Bike service being used in New York city we have determined that the areas which have more tourist and younger population are more prone to utilize the Citi bike service as a means of travel in Manhattan. Additionally, we were able to determine that the bulk of the users are male and subscribers of the service. The distance traveled using the bike are typically short and utilized during 4pm to 7pm.

## Is it worth implementing Citi Bike to Des Moines?
Page 5 - Des Moines Dashboard – DM Facts:
Des Moines has a huge female population (accounts for 50.8%). This means that Citi Bike will need to make more accommodations to cater to the female population. Considering that the female population in New York was a small margin of users. Moreover, the population size for Des Moines is much smaller than New York in comparison; therefore, we will require need to scale down the required bikes in Des Moines accordingly. The average time to travel for young workers around the age of 16 is 19 minutes. Citi bike can be a great way to help this young work force as a means of transportation.

Page 6 & 7 – Des Moines Dashboard – DM Population Age:
Des Moines majority population are younger than the age 59 years old. Which is perfect because our analysis from New York showed that the main user of the service is below the age group of 63. The median age in Des Moines falls around the age of 35 for female, and 33 for male. All positive signs of great potential.

Page 8 – Des Moines Dashboard – Earnings:
We can see that the mean/median income fall in line with the income of New York as noted in the website article from smartasset.com. Which mean people should be okay with paying for similar rates/subscriptions as in New York.
